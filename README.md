# myCNN
A small step of piglaker in DeepLearning(a simple classfier based on CNN&amp;SVM : downjack against shirt)
its function is limited only in classfy the shirt and downjack!
you can use your Python crawle to get your own dataset to train your model(since my ckpt file is too big too upload!)
scv.pkl is a pre-trained file for svm ,your can use svm to judge whether your input picture is a bad one ( i mean it is not a picture with distinct season feature !)

all my code is based on Tensorflow-slim,you had better read https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim
my model is only a simple example for you ,it is easy but you may dig its potential and expand its power with your crazy idea to make is much more coooooooooooooooooooooool!
Happy in DeepLearning!
